Text or sequence classification aims to label a sentence or document based on its content. In this post, we use [Convolutional Neural Networks]](/applied_NLP/CNN.html){:target="_blank"}
 and pre-trained embeddings to classify a novel corpus. This post provides a full treatment of the steps required to prepare data for NLP analysis and to analyze it with PyTorch. It also includes sample code to optimize the hyperparamters through state-of-the-art pruning and search algorithms via `Optuna`.
