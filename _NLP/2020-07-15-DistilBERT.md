Text or sequence classification aims to label a sentence or document based on its content. In this post, we use [Transformers](/applied_nlp/distilbert.html){:target="_blank"} to classify a novel data set that I created based on insurgent propaganda messages. This post provides a full treatment of the steps required to prepare data for NLP analysis and to analyze it with PyTorch. It also includes sample code to optimize the hyperparamters through state-of-the-art pruning and search algorithms via `Optuna`.
