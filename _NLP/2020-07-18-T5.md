There are two types of summaries: (1) abstractive, or explaining in your own words, and (2) extractive, or building a summary from existing text. Humans are mostly abstractive while NLP systems are mostly extractive. In this guide we use T5, a pre-trained and very large (e.g., roughly twice the size of BERT-base) [encoder-decoder Transformer model](/applied_nlp/T5.html){:target="_blank"}. T5, a model devised by Google, is an important advancement in the field of Transformers because it achieves near human-level performance on a variety of benchmarks like GLUE and SQuAD.
