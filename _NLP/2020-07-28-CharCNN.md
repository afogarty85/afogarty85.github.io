In this post, we use character-level [Convolutional Neural Networks](/applied_nlp/CharCNN.html){:target="_blank"} (CNN) to classify a novel data set in PyTorch. CNNs are useful in extracting information from raw signals, ranging from computer vision, speech, and text. Character-level CNNs treat text characters as a kind of raw signal, thereby allowing CNNs to eschew the requirement to develop an understanding of words. While character-level CNNs work in many different situations, they work well to handle Twitter or multilingual text as advanced embeddings are usually unavailable to researchers. In this guide, we replicate the model as specified in the paper [Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5782-character-level-convolutional-networks-for-text-classification.pdf)
