While capsule networks have been used in the field of computer vision and CNNs, recent work shows that they work well in Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well. "A capsule is a group of neurons whose outputs represent different properties of the same entity in different contexts. Routing by agreement is an iterative form of clustering in which a capsule detects an entity by looking for agreement among votes from input capsules that have already detected parts of the entity in a previous layer" (Heinsen, 2019). [Capsule networks](/applied_nlp/capsule_routing.html){:target="_blank"} are a means for aggregating the importance of embeddings akin to attention mechanisms.
