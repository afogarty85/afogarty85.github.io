Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are powerful *classification* and *regression* algorithms that can solve simple and complex linear and non-linear modeling problems. At its core, a perceptron,  based on a threshold logic unit (TLU), comprises the most basic ANN architecture.

[In this post](/applied_ml/NN.html){:target="_blank"}, we walk through the application of the neural networks through linear and nonlinear regression and classification tasks.
