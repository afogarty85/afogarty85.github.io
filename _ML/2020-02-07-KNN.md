The *K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* algorithm is part of a family of *classifier* algorithms that aim to predict the *class* or *category* of an observation. KNN works by calculating the distance, often the Euclidean (i.e., straight line) distance, between observations. [In this post](/applied_ml/KNN.html){:target="_blank"}, we walk through the application of the KNN algorithm and demonstrate the conditions under which the algorithm excels, does poorly, and is improved through feature engineering.
