Spark is on open source cluster computing framework that automates the distribution of data and computations on a cluster of computers. DataBricks handles much of the architecture and cluster management for you, leveraging Jupyter style notebooks. [This guide](/deep_learning/distributed_pytorch.html){:target="_blank"} shows how to perform distributed deep learning using PyTorch on DataBricks.
