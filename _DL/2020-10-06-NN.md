Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are powerful *classification* and *regression* algorithms that can solve simple and complex linear and non-linear modeling problems. In this post, we demonstrate the functionality of a basic deep learning multi-layer perceptron model on PyTorch using the famous MNIST data set. [In this post](/deep_learning/NN.html){:target="_blank"}, we walk through the application of multilayer perceptrons.
