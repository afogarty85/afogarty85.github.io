We can think of regularization as a general means to reduce overfitting. In practice, this means that regularizing effects aim to reduce the model capacity and/or the variance of the predictions. [In this post](/deep_learning/regularization.html){:target="_blank"}, we walk through the application of L2 regularization (manually and automatically) and dropout in PyTorch.
