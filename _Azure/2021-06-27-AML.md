[Azure Machine Learning](/applied_azure/AML.html){:target="_blank"} is an enterprise-grade machine learning service that builds and deploy models. In this guide, we will go through an end-to-end process that: (1) instantiates a work and compute space, (2) loads a tabular data set for prediction, (3) runs a single experiment, (4) scales a hyperparameter search using multiple VMs with `HyperDrive`, (5) deploys a model for inference to the web, and (6) show how to send new input data and retrieve predictions.
