[Azure Synapse Analytics](/applied_azure/synapse.html){:target="_blank"} is a limitless analytics service that brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics. It gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless or dedicated resourcesâ€”at scale. Azure Synapse brings these worlds together with a unified experience to ingest, explore, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.

In this demo, we will walk through the necessary procedures to:

* 1. Create an Azure Synapse environment
* 2. Write SQL tables to Parquet and dump them into our Data Lake
* 3. Run automated pipeline computations on our Data Lake files with AzureML
* 4. Connect our Data Lake with Azure Data Bricks for Big Data analytics
* 5. Setup Azure DevOps for Synapse version control
