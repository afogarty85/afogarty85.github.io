I am a data and political scientist that enjoys drawing inference and opportunity out of puzzles in a wide variety of contexts including: politics, conflict, democracy, institutions, and law. Faced with observational data limitations, I enjoy using multi-methods to grapple with causal inference.

I am currently enrolled in UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science program. Prior to joining UC Berkeley, I studied comparative politics at the University of Virginia. [Anne Meng](http://www.annemeng.com/){:target="_blank"} was the advisor for my [thesis](https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/pv63g0324){:target="_blank"}.
