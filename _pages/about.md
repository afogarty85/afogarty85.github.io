I am a data and political scientist that enjoys drawing inference and opportunity out of puzzles in a wide variety of contexts including: politics, conflict, democracy, institutions, and law. Faced with observational data limitations, I enjoy using multi-methods to grapple with causal inference. I am an alumni of the University of California Berkeley as well as the University of Virginia.
