How healthy is the average Instacart user? Are certain types (i.e., vegetarians, carnivores) of food buyers healthier than others? I bring new data to bear on these questions to better understand how healthy the average Instacart user is and to better understand the health benefits afforded to Instacart users who choose some types (i.e., plant-based, meat-based) of foods over others. To determine the relative health of Instacart users, I matched the top 10 most ordered products by aisle with USDA nutrient data by using USDA-provided API access to their database through JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). To view this project, please [click here](/projects/nutritionalcart/nutritionalcart.html){:target="_blank"}. An upgraded algorithm that better searches the USDA database can be found [here](https://github.com/afogarty85/fooddata_central){:target="_blank"}.
