*Map Off* is a game designed to test your geography skills in the United States or around the World. The inspiration for this game comes from my wife, Hannah, because we often test our spatial skills against one another in the presence of a map. In turn, we now have access to maps *and* competition anytime we want.

It can be played directly [here](https://repl.it/@afogarty85/PalegreenThornyRadius){:target="_blank"}. Please note that this game is a work in progress.

The python code can be found [here](https://github.com/afogarty85/map_off){:target="_blank"}.
