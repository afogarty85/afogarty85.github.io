How do civilians react to changing authority in civil war? We investigate this question in Afghanistan
using survey data from The Asia Foundation following the end of U.S.-led combat operations in 2014.
I demonstrate that there is clear evidence that civilian attitudes are indeed conditional on the following
three-way interaction: territorial control, ethnicity, and survival. For instance, there is a notable and
statistically significant distinction between Pashtuns and non-Pashtuns under Taliban control in their
approval of the Afghan Government. I bring largely unused country-wide individual-level data to bear on
analyzing civilian wartime beliefs. To view this research project, please [click here](/projects/civilian_prefs/civilian_prefs.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
