Command of language is one of the most significant cognitive abilities we possess and is often the most pervasive signal we encounter in a social media setting. When we notice overt and unintentional grammatical errors in social media posts, do we make unconscious assumptions about the authors’ general intelligence? Do we attribute difficulty with written language with other indicators such as lower-performing verbal acuity or overall intelligence? Further, are some categories of grammatical errors more injurious than others – or do we take in stride all these trespasses?
