Who are the targets of insurgent propaganda?
I investigate the ability to classify the targets
(e.g, the U.S. or Kabul) of insurgent propaganda
messages using a novel corpus containing
over 11,000 Taliban statements from 2014
to 2020. In experiments with Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and transformer architectures,
I demonstrate that the audiences of
insurgent messages are best captured by transformers,
likely owing to its encoder-decoder
architecture. This paperâ€™s contribution is twofold:
First, it offers a new and novel data set
with utility in classification and summarization
tasks for machine learning. Second, it suggests
that since the audience of messaging can
be reliably identified, new opportunities are afforded
to analysts to look closer at the contrasts
in language to better understand the targets
of information.
