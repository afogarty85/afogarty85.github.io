In 2009, a [scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal) broke out across England. Many British Members of Parliament (MPs) were exposed as misusing their allowances and expenses permitted to them as an elected official. In 2010, British voters were surveyed as to whether they think the MPs implicated in the scandal should resign or not prior to parliamentary elections. At the time of the scandal, the Labour party led by PM Gordon Brown was in power. The conservative party, led by David Cameron, won the largest number of votes and seats in the 2010 general election on the heels of the scandal. In this analysis, we use generalized linear models for [ordered categorical data](/stats/OLogit.html){:target="_blank"} to further explore the survey data.
