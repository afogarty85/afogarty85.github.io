In October 1988, a plebiscite vote was held in Chile to determine whether or not Augusto Pinochet should extend his rule for another eight years. The package carData contains Chilean national survey data collected in April and May 1988. In this analysis, we evaluate the effect that several variables have on a voter's likelihood to keep Pinochet in power using [binary regression models](/stats/logit.html){:target="_blank"}.
